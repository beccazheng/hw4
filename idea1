My program will enact a Chihuahua barking and responding to a different set of simple tasks, such as eating, drinking, petting, and barking. 
I will most likely have the different set of activies expressed as images surrounding the dog head. The user can click on any of the images and the dog will react to whichever is clicked.
The sounds will imitate whichever activity is being processed.
The background image will render a typical living room in a house.
